# Idea

Make an app that teaches people how to solve a Rubik's Cube. While Youtube tutorials are often easy to follow and are done by very good cubers, this app's goal is to make the barrier of entry even lower. The main difference between this app and Youtube tutorials is that it solves YOUR scramble using, say, the beginner method. This might help people understand better.

## To do
